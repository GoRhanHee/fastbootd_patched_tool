**Requirements:**  

- Knowledge of unpacking and repacking the `recovery.img` manually.  
    - Tools I suggest: [Android_boot_image_editor](https://github.com/cfig/Android_boot_image_editor), [AIK-Linux](https://github.com/SebaUbuntu/AIK-Linux-mirror)  
- A Linux PC.  
- [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) installed.

### ðŸŸ¢ Method

### Step 1: Preparing

01. Unpack the `recovery.img` using your preferred tool.  
02. Go to the unpacked folder and search for a file named `recovery`.  

![PATCH](images/1.png)  
*This is the file we are looking for! (near the mouse cursor)*  

03. Copy that file to a new folder.  

---

### Step 2: Setting up a Ghidra Project

01. Go to your Ghidra folder and run it with `./ghidraRun`.  
02. Create a new project, and select that "new folder" as the project's folder.  
    - `File -> New Project`

    *Creating a new project*    

03. Select your project, then go to `File -> Import File -> Select the recovery file we just extracted -> OK -> OK`.  

    ![PATCH](images/3.png)  

04. Now, right-click on the `recovery` file and select **Open in Default Tool**.  

    ![PATCH](images/4.png)  

05. Select **Yes** here:  

    ![PATCH](images/5.png)  

06. Click **Select All**, then press **Analyze**.  

    ![PATCH](images/6.png)  

07. This process will take some time to finish the analysis, so be patient!  

    ![PATCH](images/7.png)  

    - Click "Ok" if it gave any errors/warnings.  

---    

### Step 3: Finding what to patch !

01. Once the analysis is complete, the UI should look like this:  

    ![PATCH](images/8.png)  

02. On the left side of Ghidra, in the **Symbol Tree**, thereâ€™s a drop-down menu called **Functions**.  

    ![PATCH](images/9.png)  

03. Expand it and find the functions that start with a capital **I**.  

    ![PATCH](images/10.png)  

04. As you can see at the bottom of the screenshot above, there are two functions called:  
    - `isAllowFastbootdByCmdline`  
    - `isAllowFastbootdByProperty`  

**Our goal is to modify these functions so they always return `true`,** which will re-enable **fastbootd** mode!  


### Step 4: Finding the Hex Byte Sequence

01. First, letâ€™s patch the `isAllowFastbootdByCmdline` function.  
02. Left-click once on the function name to select it.  

    ![PATCH](images/11.png)  

03. In the middle section of the UI, scroll until you find the first instruction set.  

    ![PATCH](images/12.png)  

    - The highlighted part is the first instruction set of that function.  

        ![PATCH](images/13.png)  

04. Now, we need to copy the original hex byte sequence!  

    - Click and hold at the beginning of the first instruction set, then drag the cursor down to select the following instructions until the **Listing** window says `(40 addresses selected)`.  

    ![PATCH](images/14.png)  

05. Right-click anywhere in the green highlighted area â†’ **Copy Special** â†’ **Byte String (no spaces)** â†’ **OK**.  

    - Paste it into a text editor in a format thatâ€™s easy for you to read:  

    ![PATCH](images/15.png)  

**This is where the actual patching begins!**

06. Go back to Ghidra and move your cursor to the first instruction of the function.  

    ![PATCH](images/16.png)  

07. Right-click on it â†’ select **Patch Instruction**.  

    ![PATCH](images/17.png)  

08. Modify the first value (in my case, `sub`) to `mov`, and change the right-hand part to `w0, #1`. Press **Enter**.  

    - It should now look like this:  
    ![PATCH](images/18.png)  

09. For the second instruction set, clear all the existing values and change it to `ret`.  
    - In my case, the original was `stp x29, x30, [sp, #local_50]`. I replaced `stp` with `ret`. Press **Enter**.  

    - The result should be like this:  
    ![PATCH](images/19.png)  

10. On the right side of Ghidra, youâ€™ll now see that weâ€™ve successfully modified the function to always return `true`.  

    ![PATCH](images/20.png)  

11. Next, copy the patched hex byte sequence.  

    - Repeat the same process from step **05**, and paste the patched values into your text editor:  

    ![PATCH](images/21.png)  

12. Repeat the entire process for the second function, `isAllowFastbootdByProperty`, and paste its patched values into the text editor as well.  

    - The final result should look like this:  

    ![PATCH](images/22.png)  

### Step 5: Applying the Hex Patch

01. The hard part is done. All thatâ€™s left is to apply the hex patches we saved in our text editor.  

    - You can safely close Ghidra now.   

02. Download the latest Magisk APK, extract it, and copy the `libmagiskboot.so` file from the `lib/x86_64/` folder.  
    - Rename it to `magiskboot`.  
    - Give it executable permissions with:  
      `chmod +x magiskboot`  
    - Add it to your PATH.  

03. Open a terminal in the folder where the original `recovery` binary is located inside the extracted `recovery.img`.  

    - For example, in my case:  
      `/home/ravindu644/Documents/boot_editor_v15_r1/build/unzip_boot/root/system/bin`  

04. To hex patch the `recovery` file to re-enable **fastbootd** mode using `magiskboot`, use this command format:  

    ```
    magiskboot hexpatch /path/to/file <original hex> <modified hex>
    ```

    **In our case:**  

    ```
    magiskboot hexpatch recovery <From> <To>
    ```

Hereâ€™s how I patched the `recovery` binary:

```

**If it prompted `Patch @ ` like text,** that means our hex patching worked..!

> If it patches **more than 1 Patch**, that means, your patch is not unique. You have to either try to expand the address size (we choose to use 40), or make a more precise patch, targetting a specific instruction, rather than returning the whole function to **true**

**Now, re-pack the recovery image and see if it worked..!**

### Final Result:
